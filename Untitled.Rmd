## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.







# Advantage of current method
simpler model with only one parameter(beta), easier to calculate, suitable for no dataset situations


# Motivations: Need improve? Why?
# Disadvantage of current method
1. beta is fixed for all individuals, we need to consider the heterogeneity in individuals.
2. Deviated aim: Police Scotland aims at assessing the probabilities that a person is over the limit, while the parameter beta only concentrates on the range between 2.5% and 97.5%.


# New method: build a linear regression model for beta
Check if age, weight and height have linear relationships with beta.
Or have any patterns?
```{r}
beta_reg1 <- data |>
  pivot_longer(
    cols = c(age, weight, height),
    names_to = "variables",
    values_to = "value"
  )

ggplot(beta_reg1, aes(x = value, y = beta)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) + 
  facet_wrap(~ variables, scales = "free_x") +
  theme_minimal()
 
```
# Model selection: 
use drop(), look into AIC and R^2


# Hypothesis test: 
H0: C0 < limit, H1: C0 > limit 


# Calculate V_d:
in the Widmark's equation assumption, beta and V_d are independent, so we need to check whether Cov(V_d, beta) = 0


# Further research:
casual effect: biased data selection, 
(e.g. inner correlations between sex and height)
