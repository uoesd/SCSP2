\section{Executive Summary}\label{executive-summary}

In the UK it is a criminal offence to drive a motor vehicle with a blood
or breath alcohol concentration above the prescribed limit. When a
person is arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol it is not
usually possible to perform an accurate test of the level of alcohol in
the blood or breath immediately. Breath tests can be used as an initial
screening tool at the scene, but these are not sufficiently accurate for
prosecution. Instead, people are taken to a police station or hospital,
where the test can be carried out using proper laboratory protocols. As
the body clears alcohol from the blood through time this means that if
the individual was over the limit, the measured blood alcohol
concentration (BAC) will be lower at the time of measurement than it was
when the person was driving a motor vehicle. To deal with this
situation, If the BAC after time \(t\) (hours) is measured as \(C_t\)
(g/kg), the BAC at time \(0\) is estimated as \(C_0 = C_t - βt\), where
\(\beta\) (\(g/kg/h\)) is BAC elimination rate.

The key point is how to find a precise \(\beta\) to estimate \(C_0\).
Forensic scientists currently \(2.5\%\) percentile of \(\beta\)
distribution constructing from samples as the estimated \(\beta\) value
for every individuals. This method is obviously not rigorous enough for
the courts, since:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The courts will be forced to make decisions under estimated \(\beta\)
  if we only give a single estimation of \(beta\), since the calculated
  \(C_0\) is either over or under the legal limit.
\item
  Differences between individuals are ignored, for example age and sex,
  which may affect \(\beta\).
\item
  \(\beta\) value at \(2.5\%\) is over conservative and most
  uncertainties are hiding.
\end{itemize}

In this report, we will introduce a Bayesian regression model with
considering the heterogeneity between individuals, the model gives a
posterior distribution of \(\beta\) by using both samples and prior
knowledge. Then we randomly simulate \(4000\) \(\beta\) values from
posterior distribution and find out the probability of the person's BAC
over limit while driving.

In real world, \(\beta\) estimation is quite difficult, it depends on
the individuals' liver condition, drinking habits, genetic, diet, etc.
As we don't have corresponding data, in our regression model of
\(\beta\) is mainly dominate by gender, but we still find some useful
variables like `gender' and `drinking time'

When it is too late to use a blood or breath test and the only
information available is eyewitness testimony of the quantity of alcohol
consumed. We have to use Widmark's equation:
\[C_t = \frac{A}{Weight \times V_d} - \beta t\]

where \(A\) is Amount of Alcohol Consumed (g), \(V_d\) is the volume of
distribution that need to be found.

Forensic scientists use the same method again to estimate \(V_d\)
separately with \(\beta\). But \(V_d\) and \(\beta\) are not
independent, so we build a joint Bayesian regression model, which can
simulate them together to solve with the correlation. Then again after
simulation, each \(C_t\) is calculated by each pair of \(\beta\) and
\(V_d\), so expert witness can still find a probability of \(C_t\)
exceeding the limit.

To make it easier, we write the method in a function so other expert
witness can also get the results like Table \(4\) by easily plugging new
person's data.

\section{Data Description}\label{data-description}

It is important to normalized all numerical variables. Centering the
covariates can reduce autocorrelation \(\rho_k\) of lag \(k\) which is
defined as:

\[\rho_k = \frac{Cov(\theta^i, \theta^{i+k})}{\theta^2},\] \(\rho_k\)
measures how similar the sample at position \(i\) is to the sample at
position \(i+k\). As the random walk process, \(\theta_i\) is similar to
\(\theta_{i+1}\), less similar to \(\theta_{i+2}\), independent with
\(\theta_{i+k}\) for large \(k\). So if \(\rho_k\) is large means the
chains hardly move, can't converge.

As a more clear expression, we will introduce Effective Sample Size
(ESS):

\[ n_{\text{eff}} = \frac{n}{1 + 2 \sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\rho_k}\]

\(n_{\text{eff}}\) is larger means the MCMC method converge faster (for
example if we set \(4\) chains with each chains \(2000\) iterations,
\(500\) burn-in, the \(n_{\text{eff}} = 4000\) means the number of
independent samples is \(4000\) out of \(8000\)). Larger
\(n_{\text{eff}}\) in same number of iterations means smaller variance
of estimated exoectation since:

\[\mathrm{V}(\hat{E}(\beta)) \approx \frac{\sigma^2}{n_{\text{eff}}}.\]

Also Since \(\beta\) is a small value, the coefficients of large value
variables are pretty small, near 0, which will make \(\beta\) estimation
worse.

Then we prefer to \(\beta\) to \(\log(\beta)\) since the original
\(\beta\) distribution has heavy tail, all outliers (if have) can be
scaled. As shown in figure 1, \(\beta\) forms a good normal distribution
shape after log-transferring. After simulation we can take exponential
of the results.

`BAC Peak time' is converted to hours.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{Untitled_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-2-1.pdf}}
\caption{log(beta) distribution.}
\end{figure}

Since \(\beta\) is a constant rate, measured when the BAC curve reaches
peak and starts to decrease, so variables like AAC and Maximum BAC will
not be used, since they are correlated with the value of BAC, not BAC
elimination rate.

From the dataset, most data comes from age smaller than \(30\)
(\(85/100\)), so even though age is sufficient variable for \(\beta\)
the model can't really recognize it. Research shows that age doesn't
really matter unless the subject has age-related liver disease, but
because of moral and ethical, we don't find much research of alcohol
test on elderly person with liver disease.

\section{Bayesian regression model
(BRM)}\label{bayesian-regression-model-brm}

\subsection{Reason for BRM}\label{reason-for-brm}

Comparing with fitting linear regression model for \(\beta_i\), which
can be expressed as:

\[\hat{\beta}_{i,j} = \hat{\gamma}_{1}\,\text{female}_j
+ \hat{\gamma}_{2}\,\text{male}_j
+ \hat{\gamma}_{3}\,\text{weight}_j
+ \hat{\gamma}_{4}\,\text{height}_j + \varepsilon_i\]

and giving a exact value of \(\hat{\beta_i}\) for \(i_{th}\) estimation
of \(\hat{\beta}\) under \(\sigma^2_i\) for \(j_{th}\) individuals, BRM
can model uncertainty from each coefficient \(\hat{\gamma}\). We provide
priors and sample likelihoods for each variables' coefficients, BRM will
apply bayesian rule to each and output simulation results of each
coefficients, not only for \(\hat{\beta}\). \(\hat{\beta}\)s are
calculated from simulation results of \(\hat{\gamma_j}\), which is:

\[\hat{\beta}_{i,j} = \hat{\gamma}_{1,i}\,\text{female}_j
+ \hat{\gamma}_{2,i}\,\text{male}_j
+ \hat{\gamma}_{3,i}\,\text{weight}_j
+ \hat{\gamma}_{4,i}\,\text{height}_j + \varepsilon_i\]

where

\[
\varepsilon_{\beta,i} \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\, \sigma_\beta^2).
\]

Since we have log-transformed \(\beta\) data points, we will take
exponential of \(\hat{\beta_{i,j}}\) to get actual value.

\subsection{How BRM works}\label{how-brm-works}

We use \(brm\) package in R to do this.

The principle theorem behind BRM is Bayes' Rule:
\[p(\theta \mid \text{data}) = \frac{p(\text{data} \mid \theta) \, p(\theta)}{p(\text{data})}.\]

The \(\theta\) in the equation is the coefficients of \(\gamma_j\). For
most real models, we can't compute this posterior
\(p(\theta \mid \text{data})\) analytically. Markov Chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) helps us draw samples from it, which we can then summarize. BRM
uses Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (One of MCMC), which is better than
standard MCMC (like Metropolis-Hastings) since it is faster and cost
less.

After setting priors for \(\gamma_j\), we need specify a family for
\(\beta\) as the the likelihood of the observed data. In our sample, we
have already taken \(\log(\beta)\), so it is better to use the most
common normal distribution likelihood, it is normal and can express
\(\beta\) values good without restrict samples' shape.

Also for the MCMC simulation method, we set \(4\) chains, each chains
\(4000\) draws with \(1000\) burn-in draws. Since MCMC is a random walk
method through parameter space. One chain is a single run of the MCMC
algorithm that generates a sequence of samples, so we need more chains
to check the convergence and ensure that all chains convergent to same
mode.

For \(1000\) burn-in draws, since MCMC starts from an initial value
which often far from the true posterior region, so the chains need some
steps to walk to the correct trace. As figure 2 shows, it is an example
of the MCMC process of `sexfemale' when using \(4\) chains, \(100\)
draws. Clearly that if we keep the first \(25\) draws, the results will
be affected.

\subsection{Model Selection}\label{model-selection}

\subsubsection{Key Variables}\label{key-variables}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Gender: Female's BAC elimination rate is larger than male on average,
  it is explained by liver weight represents a greater fraction of lean
  body mass in the female gender {[}2{]}.
\item
  Drinking time after BAC peak: If the person keep drinking after BAC
  reaches peak, the measured \(\beta\) will be smaller since \(\beta\)
  is measured starting at BAC peak time till the end, there will be
  fluctuations on the BAC plots.
\end{itemize}

\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{Untitled_files/figure-latex/Figure -1.pdf}}
\#\#\# Priors

Before fitting the Bayesian regression model, appropriate priors need to
be specified for all regression coefficients and the residual standard
deviation. We use weakly informative priors, which have small effects on
the posterior. The selected priors are summarized as follows:

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}ll@{}}
\caption{Weakly informative priors used in the Bayesian regression
model}\tabularnewline
\toprule\noalign{}
Parameter & Prior \\
\midrule\noalign{}
\endfirsthead
\toprule\noalign{}
Parameter & Prior \\
\midrule\noalign{}
\endhead
\bottomrule\noalign{}
\endlastfoot
Regression coefficient for male & Normal(0, 2) \\
Regression coefficient for female & Normal(0, 2) \\
Regression coefficients (others) & Normal(0, 0.5) \\
Residual SD & Exponential(1) \\
\end{longtable}

All variables have been standardized and we do not expect log β to have
a linear relationship with the variables, so zero-mean normal priors are
appropriate. Based on the review by Jones (2010), sex is considered one
of the main factors influencing alcohol elimination rates. Therefore, we
set relatively wide priors Normal(0, 2) for the sex coefficients,
allowing their effects to vary within a reasonable range. For other
standardized variables (such as weight and height), since their impacts
on β are considered relatively small, we used more shrinkage weakly
informative priors Normal(0, 0.5) to prevent unreasonably large effects.
The residual standard deviation is given an Exponential(1) prior, which
is a commonly used positive weakly informative prior that can avoid
unreasonably high noise.

If future research involves different populations, larger sample sizes,
or additional biological information, the prior distributions can be
adjusted accordingly to ensure they are applicable to any new datasets.

\subsubsection{Fitting result}\label{fitting-result}

After \(4000\) iterations in \(4\) chains, Table \(2\) gives the
posterior summary. Rhat compares within-chain variance and between-chain
variance, all less than \(1.01\) means chains are well‐mixed.

Figure 3 shows posterior results for each variables' coefficients, all
coefficients show good normal patterns since we all chains have
converged and warm-up length is enough. Since the \(\beta\) is
log-transformed, the value of `b\_sexfemale' and `b\_sexmale' is not
typical value of \(\beta\) like \(0.19\) when other coefficients are all
near zero. Also \(\sigma\) value is estimated under log-transformed
\(\beta\).

convergent.

\subsubsection{PPC Density}\label{ppc-density}

Figure 5 is the Posterior Predictive Check (PPC) density plot comparing
with true value of \(\beta\) (Here we have taken exponential of both
true value and predicted value). Notice that predicted posterior
distribution matches \(\beta\) sample distribution pretty well, which
get the mean, spread, skew both right even at right tail.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Model Testing}\label{model-testing}

We take \(12000\) number of draws from the posterior distribution.
\#\#\# LOO-PIT QQ plot The Leave-One-Out Probability Integral Transform
Quantile-Quantile plot (LOO-PIT QQ plot) can check if the predictions
calibrated correctly and if the predictive distributions biased, which
is defined as:
\[ \mathrm{LOO\text{-}PIT}_i = P(\tilde{y}_i \le y_i |y_{-i}) .\]

Here we still use Monte Carlo method to simulate it, as:

\[
\mathrm{LOO\text{-}PIT}_i
= \frac{1}{S} \sum_{s=1}^{S} 
\mathbf{1}\!\left( \tilde{y}_{i,-i}^{(s)} \le y_i \right)
\] where \(S\) is the number of posterior draws. We will use it to check
if our posterior is under or over dispersion, the good model's PIT plot
should be flat over \(Uniform(0,1)\). For our model, the PIT histogram
(Figure 4) is flat everywhere except probability near 0.55 and 0.8,
which are acceptable by the randomness of MCMC method. A U-shape (points
over dot line at two tails) in PIT plots means overestimates variance,
it doesn't appear in our plot gives evidence of our choices on variables
and likelihood family.

\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{Untitled_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-9-1.pdf}}
\#\#\# Coverage rate and Errors

Table 3 shows the coverage rate of \(95\%\) and \(50\%\) predicted
intervals, which means \(98\) and \(52\) individuals' real \(\beta\)
value is inside the intervals. The MAE and RMSE are both relatively
small.

\section{Example}\label{example}

Now we will apply our model on an individual example: A \(70\) year old
female (weight: \(70\)kg, height: \(160\)cm) is arrested after being
stopped by the police while driving. She provides a blood sample to the
police \(2\) hours after her arrest which gives a reading of Ct =
\(0.15\)g/kg. The legal limit is x = \(0.47\)g/kg.

Since there is no `drinking time' data here, we will use a simplified
model with only `sex', `height', `weight' variables. We have
standardized height and weight by using sample's mean and variance.

As figure 7 shows, this is the posterior density of \(C_0\) calculated
by presicted posterior density of \(\hat{\beta}\) the dot line is the
legal limit \(C_0 = 0.47\), it can be seen that most density is larger
than \(0.47\), so obviously the 70 year old female is over the drink
driving limit.

\begin{figure}

\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{Untitled_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-11-1.pdf}}
\caption{Posterior Predictive Distribution of C\_0, message=FALSE,
warning=FALSE, with limit C\_0 = 0.47 (dot line).}
\end{figure}

To make the result clear, it is better to give Table 4 to the courts and
illustrate:

\begin{center}
There is $91.4\%$ probability that the 70 year old female is over the drink driving limit, with both mean, median and mode value over the limit.
\end{center}

The results also show that the original method is not reasonable since
\(2.5\%\) percentile is over-conservative even in this case.

\section{\texorpdfstring{Widmark's Equation and
\(V_d\)}{Widmark's Equation and V\_d}}\label{widmarks-equation-and-v_d}

When it is too late to use a blood or breath test and the only
information available is eyewitness testimony of the quantity of alcohol
consumed. We have to use Widmark's equation:
\[C_t = \frac{A}{Weight \times V_d} - \beta t.\] Since there are many
versions of Widmark's equation, it can also write as:
\[C_t = \frac{F \times A}{Weight \times \rho} - \beta t \] where

\[
\rho = \frac{TBW}{\textit{weight} \times F_{\mathrm{water}}}
\] is known as Widmark's rho factor.

\(F\) is the fraction of the dose that reaches the systemic circulation,
\(F_{\text{water}}\) is know as the water content of the blood sample,
TBW is Total Body Water.

We assume that all different part between two equations are included in
\(V_d\). The unit of \(C_t\) is g/kg in our dataset, the unit of the
first term is g/L, but it is not a problem since the density of water is
\(1\), we just ignore the \(1\).

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{\(V_d\), TBW and
\(\rho\)}{V\_d, TBW and \textbackslash rho}}\label{v_d-tbw-and-rho}

All information in this part are from `Total body water is the preferred
method to use in forensic blood-alcohol calculations rather than
ethanol's volume of distribution'{[}5{]}.

TBW is calculated by:

\[
\mathrm{TBW}_{\text{Men}}(\mathrm{L}) 
= 2.447 - (0.09516 \times \text{age}) 
    + (0.1074 \times \text{height}) 
    + (0.3362 \times \text{weight})
\]

\[
\mathrm{TBW}_{\text{Women}}(\mathrm{L}) 
= -2.097 
    + (0.1069 \times \text{height}) 
    + (0.2466 \times \text{weight}).
\]

Now subbing the \(\rho\) expression in the \(C_t\) equation, and
comparing with our equation, \(V_d\) is actually calculated by:
\[V_d = \frac{\text{TBW}}{\text{weight}} \times \frac{1}{F_{\text{water}}} \times \frac{1}{F} = \eta \times \frac{\text{TBW}}{\text{weight}}\]
and we need to estimate \(\eta\) value since TBW is a value that can be
determined in our dataset. we will use:
\[\hat{V_d}_{i,j} = \hat{\eta}_{1,i} ( \frac{\text{TBW}}{\text{weight}}_\text{male})_j + \hat{\eta}_{2.i} ( \frac{\text{TBW}}{\text{weight}}_\text{female})_j + \varepsilon_{i}\]
to estimate \(\hat{V_d}\) where \(i\) is the \(i_{th}\) iterations (we
will again use BRM, but as a joint model with \(\beta\) to deal with the
correlation, we will explain it in next part.), \(j\) is the \(j_{th}\)
individuals, \(\eta\) is the coefficients that need to be predicted.

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Joint BRM for \(\beta\) and
\(V_d\)}{Joint BRM for \textbackslash beta and V\_d}}\label{joint-brm-for-beta-and-v_d}

\(V_d\) is calculated by true value \(\beta\) (with our
log-transformed). We will not log-transformed \(V_d\) since the density
of \(V_d\) can't be improved by taking log.

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Correlations between \(\beta\) and
\(V_d\)}{Correlations between \textbackslash beta and V\_d}}\label{correlations-between-beta-and-v_d}

To show that the original method is not good because of the correlation
can't be ignored, figure 9 gives the correlations between true \(\beta\)
and \(V_d\) is \(-0.415\), which is relatively big.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Fitting model and Results}\label{fitting-model-and-results}

The mathematical expression of the joint model can be expressed as:

\[
\hat{\beta}_{i,j} = \hat{\gamma}_{1,i}\,\text{female}_j
+ \hat{\gamma}_{2,i}\,\text{male}_j
+ \hat{\gamma}_{3,i}\,\text{weight}_j
+ \hat{\gamma}_{4,i}\,\text{height}_j + \sigma^2_{i,\beta}.
\] and
\[\hat{V_d}_{i,j} = \hat{\eta}_{1,i} ( \frac{\text{TBW}}{\text{weight}}_\text{male})_j + \hat{\eta}_{2.i} ( \frac{\text{TBW}}{\text{weight}}_\text{female})_j + \varepsilon_{i,V_d}\]

where \[
\begin{pmatrix}
\varepsilon_{\beta,i} \\
\varepsilon_{V_d,i}
\end{pmatrix}
\sim
\mathcal{N}\!\left(
\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix},
\begin{pmatrix}
\sigma_\beta^2 
& 
\rho \, \sigma_\beta \sigma_{V_d}
\\[6pt]
\rho \, \sigma_\beta \sigma_{V_d}
& 
\sigma_{V_d}^2 
\end{pmatrix}
\right).
\]

\subsubsection{Model Selection (priors)}\label{model-selection-priors}

The prior for \(\beta\)'s variables' coefficients is unchanged. And the
prior for \(\eta\) is easy to calculated since
\(\eta = \frac{1}{F_{\text{water}}} \times \frac{1}{F}\).

The Blood water content \(F_{\text{water}}\) is easy to determine by
desiccation and the mean reported values for men and women are
\(0.825\%\) w/v and \(0.838\%\) w/v respectively. The small sex
difference is mainly attributed to lower haematocrit in female blood
samples{[}{]}.

The fraction of the alcohol dose that reaches the systemic circulation
\(F\) is typically \(0.7\)−\(0.9\). So:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Prior for \(\frac{\text{TBW}}{\text{weight}}_\text{male}\) is
  \(Normal(\frac{1}{0.825} \times \frac{1}{0.8}, 2)  = Normal(1.51, 2)\)
\item
  Prior for \(\frac{\text{TBW}}{\text{weight}}_\text{male}\) is
  \(Normal(\frac{1}{0.848} \times \frac{1}{0.8}, 2)  = Normal(1.49, 2)\)
\end{itemize}

The mean value of two priors is actually near to the linear regression
results of single \(V_d\) model (\(1.41\) for male and \(1.3\) for
female).

Priors for others are still weak informative priors. Setting for others
are not changed (\(4\) chains, \(4000\) iterations, \(1000\) warm-up).
